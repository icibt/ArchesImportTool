# ArchesImportTool

This tool can be used to genereate the needed .arches file when we have the existing data that we want to import saved in Excel.

The tool can configured by changing the values in the configuration files located in the /Configuration directory.

GUI is currently in Slovenian because this tool started as an ad-hoc solution. But it will be soon translated to English.
